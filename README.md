# Data Science for Ecologists and Environmental Scientists
Course materials

This repository contains all the data needed to complete the tutorials and challenges of the course. Contents are organised according to the three course streams:

* Stats from Scratch (getting started in R)
* Wiz of Data Viz (data visualisation)
* Mastering Modelling (advanced data analysis)

If you intend to complete most or all tutorials within a stream, we recommend cloning the relevant folder to your computer. If you wish to handpick tutorials across streams, each [tutorial](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/) has a direct link to its material folder. 

Coding Club is a peer-to-peer learning community based at the University of Edinburgh - you can find our website at https://ourcodingclub.github.io/

Our materials are free to share and we welcome feedback at ourcodingclub@gmail.com
